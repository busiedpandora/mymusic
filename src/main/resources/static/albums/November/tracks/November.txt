Crying on the side
You thieving little lie
I suppose we’re only human

Now it’s starting again
Your insinuations
Now I’ll never know the truth

So it’s now or forever hold
May I be so bold
I suppose I’m only human

Now it’s starting again
Your insinuations
Now I’ll never know the truth

Try again
One more time
One more time

Now it’s starting again
Your insinuations
Now I’ll never know the truth
